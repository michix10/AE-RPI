something else, post in the AlexELEC [Forum] instead. If it turns out that it is
a bug, an issue can always be opened later.

If you are sure that it's a bug in AlexELEC and you have not found a [similar issue], open a new [issue]
and try to answer the following questions:
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What happened instead?

**It is also importent to provide logs for debugging.
A zip file can be found in the [logfiles] samba share, this will contain all the logs needed.**

Feature requests are great, but they usually end up lying around the issue
tracker indefinitely. Sending a pull request is a much better way of getting a
particular feature into AlexELEC.

Please dont ask us to add 3rdparty drivers unless you are the maintainer/developer of the driver,
we have no manpower to support a non-mainlined kernel driver for your hardware.
However, AlexELEC comes with minimal set of kernel drivers enabled, if you are sure that your hardware
is supported in mainline kernel, feel free to send us a Pull Request to enable it in our
kernel defconfigs. We are always happy to support known-working hardware.
